This notebook evaluates various machine learning approaches to credit card fraud detection. The dataset is from the Credit Card Fraud Detection at Kaggle, which contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders: 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.

The business objective of a fraud detection system is essentially finding the optimal sensitivity of the fraud filter to maximize its economic benefits.
